If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

-> from the top 100 songs, since spotify keeps the data of the danceability, loudness, energy, speechiness, valence, tempo
and the length of songs along with the frquency in which a person listens to these songs and the time they listen it to,
we could simply find out the average of these metrics and compare it to the audio aura colours like orange for high energy and loud music,
yellow for calm and lower tempo and less speechiness and so on.

----

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

-> it is very difficult to properly categorize a person's personality and aura let alone with the type of music they listen to.
there may be instances where the type of person whose personality type resembles calm and tranquil may actually
listen to very high energetic, loud and obnoxious type of music which doesnt match the description of calm and tranquil so
the way aura has been calculated might not be representative of the listener.

better ways of calculating a persons aura may be to analyze their personal behaviours and their way of living life and dealing with
the ebbs and flows of life rather than calculating the average tempo of the music they listen to.
